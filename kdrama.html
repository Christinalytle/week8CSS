            </p>
            <p><strong>Review</strong></p>
            <p>This is by far the best K-Drama out there. It's fulll of magic, romance, and comedy. Gong Yoo who plays
                Goblin is the best part of this show. </p>

            <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
            <p>A "night courier" with the codename "Healer" who possesses 
                 top-notch fighting skills, a reporter from a second-rate tabloid news website, and a famous journalist at a major broadcast
                  station try to uncover the truth from a 1992 incident and a series of present day murders, they grow 
                  into honest reporters who try to blur the lines of conflict between truth and reality, even if that means fighting media honchos.</p>
            <p><strong>Review</strong></p>
            <p>This K-Drama is for everyone. It has action, mystery, and romance. Ji Chang-Wook steals the show and is fantastic. It's a drama that you will

            <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
            <p>Eun Chan is a licensed taekwondo instructor who parts time as a delivery woman. One day, she comes across a delivery order that leads her to Han Gyeol,
                 an heir to a conglomerate. Her boyish appearance deceives everyone into thinking that she's a strong man with a petite figure. Han Gyeol, on the other hand,
                  being relatively close to men leads his grandmother to think he's gay. Eun Chan and Han Gyeol's entanglement lead to them working in a cafe, which soon brews
                   a different kind of love story. They face multiple problems along the way that bring themselves closer and their love stronger than ever.</p>
            <p><strong>Review</strong></p>
            <p>This is a very forward thinking K-Drama for its time. It's a wonderful story about love and loving a person, not a gender. Gong Yoo once again is memorizing, 
                but the writing is what makes this a great show.

                hearing and speed. Later, he discovers that he has three months left on Earth. And that is when he meets Cheon Song Yi, the biggest Hallyu star in Korea. </p>
            <p><strong>Review</strong></p>
            <p>My Love from the Star is a really fun K-Drama. It has great comedy and romance (and some cool Korean history). Jun Ji Hyun is so funny and has a wonderful character arch. </p>

            <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
            <p> Lee Yeong Joon is vice president of his family-owned company, Yoomyung Group. He is so narcissistic that he doesnâ€™t pay attention to what his trusty secretary, 
                Kim Mi So. After nine years of making Yeong Joon look good and stroking his very large ego, Min So decides to quit her job.
                Can Yeong Joon accept the fact that Mi So no longer wants to work for him or will he get the wrong idea?</p>
            <p><strong>Review</strong></p>
            <p>WWWSK is a good workplace K-Drama. It covers a lot of what a Korean workplace would be like. This is a fun, lighthearted comedy, with a great supporting cast. The dispute between the two brothers
                is a little problamatic and poor storytelling, but the relationship between Yeong Joon and Mi So is amazing.
