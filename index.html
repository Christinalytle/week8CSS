            <p>Life is a journey with many turns and many roads. My education and background is in the performing arts, but I had to take 
                a left turn when I had my daughter five days before the world shut down due to COVID-19, and my industry came to a halt and is almost vanishing.<br><br>
                I have always been interested in technology and web design. I helped implement two new websites at different companies and fell in love with coding. 
                I decided to take time off to be with my newborn and learn to code (backend and frontend). <br><br>
                I hope to show my daughter that girls can be in technology and create amazing things with just a few lines of code. <br><br><br>
                Welcome to my website! I hope you learn more about me, my skills, and maybe some K-Pop and K-Drama culture!</p>
